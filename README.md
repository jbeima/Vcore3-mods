## Vertical PSU mount

Based on [Vertical_PSU_Mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/madfabrications/Vertical_PSU_Mount) from community Voron mods.

I modified `PsuMountSpring.stl` so power supply (LRS/RSP 200W) can be mounted vertically on DIN rails in V-core 3 - space was tiny bit too large to fit without modifications. I have my DIN rails mounted using existing holes used for mounting [electronics panel](https://github.com/Rat-Rig/V-core-3/blob/main/cad/panels/DXF/Metric%20Units%20(mm)/300/panel_electronics_plain_300.dxf).

I own 300x300x300 and cannot guarantee if it will work for other sizes - no idea what's DIN rail spacing there.
